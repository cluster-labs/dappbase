### Today, we brain storm about user opportunities:
- Who are our target users?
- What value are we providing to them as a platform?
- What value are they providing to the community?

### Plus
- What do I need in a co-founder?

Let's start :)

### Who ~~are our target~~ can be our users?
- designers
- developers
    - front-end
    - back-end
    - blockchain
    - ai
    - literally any dev
- tech enthusiasts (aka average internet users)
- students
- learners
- teachers
- authors
- streamers
- developer advocates
- enterprises
- startups
- schools
- local communities
- hackathons
- bootcamps
- come on people. It's an open community. And it's free to join. Why not to join?
Well, if was that easy to get people join you, then there would never be this GAP.

## Idea alert
- You as a user on the platform can set up your preferences, hobbies, interests etc, so that we can help you explore projects that you might be interested in + From your past contributions on github or any other platforms, we can try to judge what kind of projects you might be interested in.
So, it's like Netflix for designers/developers/everyone where you are recomended different projects(**binge expore projects**) that you maybe interested in, or who needs specific help from a designer etc.

### What ~~value are we providing~~ can we provide to them as a platform?
- designers:
    - Where do the designers come in the process of building a project?
    - Making it really easy for the developers to explore the projects that they may be interested in. So, it's like Netflix for designers/developers/everyone where you are recomended different projects that you maybe interested in, or who needs specific help from a designer etc.
    - What tools do they need? What is good versioning tool for a designer?
    - How can I as a contributor on a project, can specify what do I need from a designer
    - How can I as a designer build a porfolio around my contributed projects?
    - Why will I as a designer come
        - to contribute to open-source?
        - to join SimpleAsWater?
- developers

- tech enthusiasts (aka average internet users)
    - Decentralized space has a lot of promise for a lot of industries, who can benefit from a decentralized model, or parts of it. The main barrier is that as most of the people don't have must understanding of the possiblities of what is possible and how can it be implemented. This barrier is slowing down the web3 adoption a lot. **SimpleAsWater aims to bridge this gap by facilitating a community that can self-support itself.**
    - A lot of times, people have ideas(that maybe not perfect, but interesting/important enough to work upon) but they lack in skills and resources to make it happen. There can be a section in which people can vote on ideas and work on them.
    - Binge exploring projects from [Idea alert](#idea-alert).
    - In what ways can a tech enthusiast contribute to a project?
    - Why will a tech enthusiast contribute to open source?
    - Apart from being a contributor in an open source project, what benefits can a tech enthusiast get from a platfrom like this?
