### Apps people want to make:

- twitter
- instagram
- whatsapp
- facebook
- amazon
- sketch app
- youtube

### Why people build Dapps?
- Just for Fun (Small Dapps)
- Centralized counterpart has some flaws that can be solved using decentralized infra. (Serious, Big Dapps)

### What is Dappbase about?
- Community (Devs, designers, idea providers[don't know how to code? Just pitch in some idea and let others see if they want to work on that idea])
- Make it UNBELIEVABLY easy to build a Dapp


### What we can provide?
- Ability to build Cross-platform dapps. 
- Easy to build, REUSABLE components.


### How can we make it easy to build dapps?
- Break the dapp into components:
    - Auth: 
    - Storage:
    - Database:

### Case study: Twitter
Twitter needs:
- Auth
- Database/Storage to store tweets, images etc.
- p2p communication mechanism to make nodes/devices talk. 
- Hosting your apps

### Conclusion:
- Networking is hard. We need a way to abstract the libs that can be plug-n-played with different applications.
- Make Auth more easier to import. Maybe add some opiniated options so that the dev doesn't have to do much to get started.
- See how you can provide storage for different platforms? Browser limitations.
- make hosting SUPER easy for different languages. Right now we can do HTML, CSS, JS. How we can add languages that need some node serving it? The programs will still be running as they run, but the networking will be done over Libp2p rather that OSI stack(TCP/IP server-client model).
